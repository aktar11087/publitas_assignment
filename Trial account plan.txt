# Google Workspace domain trial account action plan

Create 2 Superadmin Users:
You can create manually through the Google Workspace Admin Console. 

Here are the steps:
Log in to the Google Workspace Admin Console with your Superadmin account.
Go to "Users" and click on the "+" icon to add new users.
Fill in the details for each Superadmin user, such as email address, full name, job position, etc.

Send Superadmin User Invitation:
You can invite the second Superadmin user by sending them an email invitation from the Google Workspace Admin Console. Here's how:
Go to "Users" in the Admin Console.
Locate the user with the email address "system@publitas.com."
Click on the user's name to open their details.
Click on the "Email" icon to send an invitation email.

Create 8 Regular Users from a CSV File:
Prepare a CSV file with user details, including UserName, Full Name, and Job Position. The CSV file should have columns like "Full Name," and "Job Position."

Bash script that reads user details from a CSV file and creates 8 regular users using the useradd command on a Linux system:

Save the above script in a file, for example, create_users.sh, and give it executable permissions:

$chmod 777 create_users.sh

You can then run the script by providing the CSV file as an argument:

$sudo ./create_users.sh path/to/users.csv

Make sure your CSV file has the following format (without the header row):

Username,Full Name,Job Position
user1,User One,Engineer
user2,User Two,Designer
user3,User Three,Manager

# Add more users as needed
The script will read the CSV file, create the users, and set their passwords. You can customize the script to fit your specific needs and password generation logic if necessary.


Create Google Drive Shared Folders:
To create Google Drive shared folders, you can manually create them in your Google Drive and set the appropriate sharing permissions according to the Publitas_Asset_Management_and_Classification_Policy and ISMS policies.
Keep in mind that you might need to adjust the scripts and configurations to meet your specific requirements and ensure compliance with your organization's policies. Additionally, make sure to test the scripts in a controlled environment before applying them to your production system.

Remember that these scripts are for illustrative purposes, and you should always review and verify any scripts you plan to use for your organization.
